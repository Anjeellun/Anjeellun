### Hi there, I'm Jel 👋

🎓 Currently navigating the exciting world of academia, I find myself immersed in the dynamic realm of computer science, constantly exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.

💡 My interests are as diverse as my coding journey—whether it's crafting seamless user interfaces, delving into the intricacies of front-end development, or orchestrating projects with a touch of finesse through project management.

🚀 Armed with a linguistic arsenal that includes Python, C, C++, Java, and the markup mastery of HTML and CSS, I'm on a mission to bring ideas to life through the language of code.

🌐 Beyond the realms of syntax, I'm captivated by the dance of colors and pixels in the UI/UX space, aiming to create designs that not only look good but feel intuitive and user-friendly.
