### Hi everyone, I'm Jel~! ðŸ‘‹

I'm genuinely passionate about project management, game development, web, and mobile apps. I find it exciting to take an idea, figure out how to bring it to life, and build something real that people can actually use.

I enjoy learning by doing and constantly exploring new tools and workflows. Writing code is one part of it, but I also care a lot about how people experience what I create. A good product should work well, but also feel smooth and easy to use.

If you're into similar things or working on something cool, feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to connect!
